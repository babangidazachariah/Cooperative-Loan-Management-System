what other task people like
president, financial sec., etc
accomplish?


how many loan applications can a member
submit?

who is in charge of approving loans?




how do we determine how much a member pays
or is deducted from member's salary at month end?


for every loan not approved, allow the president to
make a comment which should be visible to the applicant.

add a list of those for whom their loans have been approved, and 
their balances : cleared or uncleared.
